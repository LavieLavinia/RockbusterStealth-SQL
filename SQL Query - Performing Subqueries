SQL expression for performing subqueries to identify the average paid amount by top 5 customers and number of top 5 customer within country.

STEP 1: FIND THE AVERAGE AMOUNT PAID BY THE TOP 5 CUSTOMERS

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM
(
	SELECT A.customer_id AS customerID,
	       A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
	       A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
	       D.country AS country,
         C.city AS city, 
	       SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Cape Coral', 'Santa Brbara dOeste', 'Memphis', 'Tanza', 'Valparai', 'Santa Rosa', 'Aurora', 'Tanauan', 'Halisahar', 'Bijapur')
GROUP BY customerID, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
) AS total_amount_paid --subquery renamed as totalamountpaid
 
STEP 2: FIND OUT HOW MANY OF THE TOP 5 CUSTOMERS ARE BASED WITHIN EACH COUNTRY

SELECT D.country AS country, 
	     COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	     COUNT(DISTINCT customer_first_name) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(
SELECT A.customer_id AS customerID, 
       A.first_name AS customer_first_name, 
       A.last_name AS customer_last_name, 
       D.country AS country,
       C.city AS city,
       SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Cape Coral', 'Santa Brbara dOeste', 'Memphis', 'Tanza', 'Valparai', 'Santa Rosa', 'Aurora', 'Tanauan', 'Halisahar', 'Bijapur')
GROUP BY customerID, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
) AS top_5_customers ON top_5_customers.country = D.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
