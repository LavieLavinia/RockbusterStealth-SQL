SQL expression using CTEs to identify the average paid amount by top 5 customers and number of top 5 customer within country.

STEP 1: FIND THE AVERAGE AMOUNT PAID BY THE TOP 5 CUSTOMERS

WITH top5_customer_cte (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid)
AS
 (SELECT  A.customer_id,
	        A.first_name,
	        A.last_name,
	        D.country,
      	  C.city, 
	        SUM(E.amount)
   FROM customer A
   INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
   INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
   INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
   INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id
   WHERE C.city IN ('Cape Coral', 'Santa Brbara dOeste', 'Memphis', 'Tanza', 'Valparai', 'Santa Rosa', 'Aurora', 'Tanauan', 'Halisahar', 'Bijapur')
   GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
   ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
   LIMIT 5
 )
 SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
 FROM top5_customer_cte 

STEP 2: FIND OUT HOW MANY OF THE TOP 5 CUSTOMERS ARE BASED WITHIN EACH COUNTRY

WITH 
country_customer_cte (country, all_customer_count)
AS
 (SELECT D.country,  
	       COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) 
  FROM customer A
  JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  GROUP BY D.country
 ),
top5_customer_cte (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid)
AS
 (SELECT A.customer_id,
	       A.first_name,
	       A.last_name,
	       D.country,
      	 C.city, 
	       SUM(E.amount)
   FROM customer A
   JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
   JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
   JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
   JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id
   WHERE C.city IN ('Cape Coral', 'Santa Brbara dOeste', 'Memphis', 'Tanza', 'Valparai', 'Santa Rosa', 'Aurora', 'Tanauan', 'Halisahar', 'Bijapur')
   GROUP BY A.customer_id,
	          A.first_name,
	          A.last_name,
	          D.country,
      	    C.city
   ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
   LIMIT 5
 )
 SELECT F.country, F.all_customer_count, COUNT(DISTINCT G.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
 FROM country_customer_cte F
 LEFT JOIN top5_customer_cte G ON F.country = G.country
 GROUP BY F.country, F.all_customer_count
 ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
